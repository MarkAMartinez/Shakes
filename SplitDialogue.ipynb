first  if your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more in your respect  on my life my  a bubble  believe it my  in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman hes a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainment first  it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you  none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do  i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything first  o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem fort when your lordship sees the  o for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand  a pox on t let it go tis but a drum  that was not to be blamd in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that  but the attempt i vow  no more than a fish loves water is not this a strange

stings his nature for on the reading it he changd almost into another  he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a  especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the  when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the grave of it first  he hath perverted a  now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are we first  merely our own traitors and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorrd ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream oerflows himself  is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents we shall not then have his company tonight first  not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour  that approaches apace i would gladly have him see his company anatomizd that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit first  we will not meddle with him till he
